# ACP Editor Integration

anan Agent can run as an ACP server, letting ACP-compatible editors talk to anan Agent over stdio and render:

- chat messages
- tool activity
- file diffs
- terminal commands
- approval prompts
- streamed thinking / response chunks

ACP is a good fit when you want anan Agent to behave like an editor-native coding agent instead of a standalone CLI or messaging bot.

## What anan Agent exposes in ACP mode

anan Agent runs with a curated `anan-acp` toolset designed for editor workflows. It includes:

- file tools: `read_file`, `write_file`, `patch`, `search_files`
- terminal tools: `terminal`, `process`
- web/browser tools
- memory, todo, session search
- skills
- execute_code and delegate_task
- vision

It intentionally excludes things that do not fit typical editor UX, such as messaging delivery and cronjob management.

## Installation

Install anan Agent normally, then add the ACP extra:

```bash
pip install -e '.[acp]'
```

This installs the `agent-client-protocol` dependency and enables:

- `anan acp`
- `anan-acp`
- `python -m acp_adapter`

## Launching the ACP server

Any of the following starts anan Agent in ACP mode:

```bash
anan acp
```

```bash
anan-acp
```

```bash
python -m acp_adapter
```

anan Agent logs to stderr so stdout remains reserved for ACP JSON-RPC traffic.

## Editor setup

### VS Code

Install the [ACP Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.acp-client) extension.

To connect:

1. Open the ACP Client panel from the Activity Bar.
2. Select **anan Agent** from the built-in agent list.
3. Connect and start chatting.

If you want to define anan Agent manually, add it through VS Code settings under `acp.agents`:

```json
{
  "acp.agents": {
    "anan Agent": {
      "command": "anan",
      "args": ["acp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Zed

Example settings snippet:

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "anan": {
      "type": "custom",
      "command": "anan",
      "args": ["acp"],
    },
  },
}
```

### JetBrains

Use an ACP-compatible plugin and point it at:

```text
/path/to/anan/acp_registry
```

## Registry manifest

The ACP registry manifest lives at:

```text
acp_registry/agent.json
```

It advertises a command-based agent whose launch command is:

```text
anan acp
```

## Configuration and credentials

ACP mode uses the same anan Agent configuration as the CLI:

- `~/.anan/.env`
- `~/.anan/config.yaml`
- `~/.anan/skills/`
- `~/.anan/state.db`

Provider resolution uses anan Agent's normal runtime resolver, so ACP inherits the currently configured provider and credentials.

## Session behavior

ACP sessions are tracked by the ACP adapter's in-memory session manager while the server is running.

Each session stores:

- session ID
- working directory
- selected model
- current conversation history
- cancel event

The underlying `AIAgent` still uses anan Agent's normal persistence/logging paths, but ACP `list/load/resume/fork` are scoped to the currently running ACP server process.

## Working directory behavior

ACP sessions bind the editor's cwd to the anan Agent task ID so file and terminal tools run relative to the editor workspace, not the server process cwd.

## Approvals

Dangerous terminal commands can be routed back to the editor as approval prompts. ACP approval options are simpler than the CLI flow:

- allow once
- allow always
- deny

On timeout or error, the approval bridge denies the request.

## Troubleshooting

### ACP agent does not appear in the editor

Check:

- the editor is pointed at the correct `acp_registry/` path
- anan Agent is installed and on your PATH
- the ACP extra is installed (`pip install -e '.[acp]'`)

### ACP starts but immediately errors

Try these checks:

```bash
anan doctor
anan status
anan acp
```

### Missing credentials

ACP mode does not have its own login flow. It uses anan Agent's existing provider setup. Configure credentials with:

```bash
anan model
```

or by editing `~/.anan/.env`.
